# Equip9 Solutions

This repository contains solutions for three different problems related to equipment rental and maintenance management.

## 1. Equipment Rental Availability (Graph Algorithm – BFS/DFS)

Finds the shortest path to available equipment in a network of rental providers using BFS.

[View Solution](README_RENTAL.md)

## 2. Optimal Equipment Deal Matching (Heap/Priority Queue)

Matches equipment buyers with sellers using a Priority Queue to find the best-priced deals.

[View Solution](README_DEAL_MATCHER.md)

## 3. Maintenance Log Analysis (Segment Tree)
